      <h1>“We touch bros but we no gay”: The hidden intimacies of Ghana’s fraud boys</h1>
      <p class="dek">
        Padlocked inside for months to work on online scams, young men are forbidden to touch women as part of a cleansing ritual.
        In the silence of that isolation, they reach for each other—and sometimes for trans women—exploiting a loophole that stays behind closed doors.

      <!-- CHAPTER: OPEN -->
      <div class="chapter" data-label="Opening"><span>Opening</span><i></i></div>

      <p class="lede reveal">
        Uche Kamal* built his first fortune by inventing an orphanage that didn’t exist. At twenty, with nothing but a borrowed computer in a dingy Accra internet café, he wrote to a Christian charity in the UK, spinning a story of abandoned children and desperate need. They sent $700 and he pocketed every cedi.
      </p>

      <p class="reveal">
        But, as he tells me now at 32, his path into the world of fraud began much earlier, at seventeen, when he left a quiet village in Umuaru, Imo State, for Ghana. His father had just died, and life at home had grown unbearably hard for his mother and seven younger siblings, meaning school was no longer an option. So when an uncle offered him a place in Abbossey Okai, a bustling spare-parts district in Accra, to learn the trade and earn something, he agreed.
      </p>

      <p class="reveal">
        In Ghana, he shared a room with eight other people in a slum near the Accra Cocoa Marketing Board station. He hated every part of it, he told me, sucking his teeth and dabbing at the sweat on his face with a handkerchief. He was the youngest in the stifling room and was constantly sent on errands by the older men, even when he was exhausted from sleeping on the floor.
      </p>

      <p class="reveal">
        One of the senior boys from Lagos took a liking to him for his obedience and became his first mentor. At 20, he taught him how to smoke and began taking him along on his daily rounds, which often involved working out of local internet cafés in Accra. It was there Uche was introduced to the budding criminal underworld of penpal culture and Yahoo Mail chatrooms, which cybercriminals used to meet clients.
      </p>

      <div class="quote reveal">
        <blockquote>“African men also deserve a shot at life, to be rich and have access to cars and houses like white men and celebrities did.”</blockquote>
        <small>— Uche Kamal</small>
      </div>

      <p class="reveal">
        Shortly after was when he made his first money $700 fortune from the UK Christian Charity. He reinvested that money into more successful scams, selling fictitious land and gold to men in Australia and the US.
      </p>

      <p class="reveal">
        Now, Uche considers himself successful. He owns three houses—two in Accra and one in Tamale—and a string of restaurants generating legitimate income. He has four personal cars and more than eleven tricycles operating for him just in northern Ghana.
      </p>

      <p class="reveal">
        A busy man, Uche had postponed our meeting several times over eight months since we were first introduced by my ex-boyfriend. Even during our eventual meeting at a studio on the outskirts of Tamale (one of West Africa’s fastest growing cities), his phone kept ringing and buzzing with text messages. After I politely asked him to turn it off, we started our conversation.
      </p>

      <!-- CHAPTER: CONTEXT -->
      <div class="chapter" data-label="Context"><span>Context</span><i></i></div>

      <p class="reveal">
        I had taken a deep interest in researching the role of secrecy in male intimacy and male/male sexual relationships after first discussing the habits of “fraud boys” — young internet scammers operating primarily in Ghana — with my ex-boyfriend.
      </p>

      <p class="reveal">
        Cybercrime, locally known as sakawa, started gaining prominence in Ghana in the late 1990’s. This term, derived from Hausa words loosely interpreted as “put inside” or “put money inside,” has come to represent a complex combination of internet fraud (mainly romance scams) and traditional spiritual practices that shape the lives of many poor young Ghanaian men.
      </p>

      <p class="reveal">
        It is believed to have originated from Zongo (predominantly muslim) communities such as Nima, Mamobi, and Accra New Town. It evolved from the penpal culture that flourished as Ghana encouraged internet adoption and ICT growth. It became more sophisticated with the influx of foreigners and the increase in knowledge exchange, especially between youth in Ghana and Nigeria As internet access spread, so did sakawa.
      </p>

      <p class="reveal">
        In 2007, these scams became intertwined with ritual practices, as many fraudsters began consulting traditional spiritualists to manipulate their victims. By 2013, Ghana ranked second in Africa and seventh globally in cybercrime rates, prompting public outcry and eventual government intervention.
      </p>

      <!-- CHAPTER: PADLOCK -->
      <div class="chapter" data-label="Padlock"><span>Padlock</span><i></i></div>

      <p class="reveal">
        I visited one of Uche’s houses one midnight in July, accompanied by my ex-boyfriend, who first introduced us. The house, known among the boys as “Padlock” was an unassuming building with two bedrooms, a large hall, a kitchen downstairs, and at least three more rooms upstairs. The name carried its own history. In their world, “Padlock” refers to long periods (usually months) of working in a house that the fraud boys never leave. It means total immersion in the work of scamming and is designed to eliminate any external distractions.
      </p>

      <p class="reveal">
        The house was what I can only describe as a sanctified scammer sanctuary where contact with the outside world, especially with women, was absolutely discouraged. The boys entered the house and did not come out for months yet the dedication and discipline I saw on their faces shocked me. I counted eleven young men inside the house—five of whom I spoke to. All were Ghanaians. The eldest, 27-year-old Joey* from Agona Swedru, had been padlocked for three years.
      </p>

      <div class="quote reveal">
        <blockquote>“I want to make $200,000 before I leave this place or talk to my family in person again.”</blockquote>
        <small>— Joey</small>
      </div>

      <!-- CHAPTER: RITUALS -->
      <div class="chapter" data-label="Rituals"><span>Rituals, luck, and brotherhood</span><i></i></div>

      <p class="reveal">
        One evening at the beachside with my ex-boyfriend, I asked about rumours of coffins and rituals among fraud boys and how true they were. In the 2000s, when I was growing up as a teen, several stories on the local news and movies about the rituals of fraud boys had traumatised me and my cousins. There were stories of fraudsters engaging in ritual practices involving coffins and abstaining from bathing to attract luck.
      </p>

      <p class="reveal">
        My ex laughed and assured me there were no coffins, at least not with the boys he knew. But he did not deny the rumours of no-bathing, explaining that each scammer adopted different routines for luck. It was a combination of modern technology and traditional African spirituality.
      </p>

      <!-- CHAPTER: WE TOUCH BROS -->
      <div class="chapter" data-label="We touch bros"><span>“We touch bros but we no gay”</span><i></i></div>

      <p class="reveal">
        Equipped with the internet, spiritual cleansing, and basic needs, the fraud boys began their work. Due to time zone differences, they slept during the day and worked at night.
      </p>

      <p class="reveal">
        Much of their job involved fabricating elaborate stories. Joey created two profiles: a white gay bartender and PhD student in Ohio, and a young widowed white woman in Alaska. He even purchased photos to match. During the 2020–2021 COVID lockdowns, a market emerged for complete scam profiles; photos, nudes, IDs, bank accounts.

        “You just needed to know where to look and have money to pay,” Joey says.

      <p class="reveal">
        With the support of Uche and collective knowledge-sharing, the work was relatively easy. The hard part was abstaining.

      <div class="quote reveal">
        <blockquote>“The hardest part of padlocking is the lack of sex and not touching women… It might be dirty to sleep with a woman, but they say nothing about boys or trans girls.”</blockquote>

      <p class="reveal">
        He describes how the young men coped—masturbating alone, or together, sometimes inviting trans women. “We touch bros but we no gay,” he insists.
      </p>

      <p class="reveal">
        The others echoed similar sentiments—silent nods rather than words. It was brotherhood and convenience and it was done with the understanding that nobody would ever talk about it later.
      </p>

      <p class="reveal">
        A code of secrecy protected this and as long as it was never acknowledged, it was not a problem. Self-intimacy, penetrative sex (with each other or trans people) and shared masturbation together were loopholes in the spiritual instruction to abstain from women. As long as they bathed with holy water blessed by their prophetess, they believed they were clean. This is how they lived, absolutely nothing gay.
      </p>

      <p class="reveal">
        When we reconnected in 2025, Joey told me he had finally made his $200,000 and left the padlock house, making roughly $375,000 for Uche.
      </p>

      <p class="reveal">
        “Uche was a good, kind and just man but the 65% cut he took from the boys was too much,” he says. “He had even raised it to 68%. It was a little too much and sometimes the boys complained.”
      </p>

      <p class="reveal">
        As he spoke, I thought of the 27-year-old I first met in Agona Swedru, the boy who just wanted to finish school after his mother died. He now owns property in Dubai and Tamale, but he still speaks of Uche with a mix of respect and quiet resentment, remembering the long nights, the holy water baths, and the secrets they all agreed to carry.
